2. Core Components of a LangChain ReAct Agent

    ReAct = Reasoning + Acting
    This framework is built on 3 core components:

    (a) LLM (Large Language Model)

        The brain of the agent.
        It’s responsible for reasoning — deciding what to do next.
        The LLM reads the prompt, interprets tool results, and figures out the next step.

    (b) Tools

        These are actions the agent can take — like calculators, APIs, or database queries.
        Each tool has:

        A name

        A description of when to use it

        A function that executes the action

        Example tools:

            SearchTool → searches the web

            Calculator → performs math

            PythonREPL → runs Python code

    (c) Prompt Structure

        This defines how the agent thinks and acts.
        The prompt usually includes:

        System message: Explains the role and behavior of the agent.

        Examples: Show how to format thoughts, actions, and observations.

        User input: The current question or task.

    The ReAct prompt encourages the model to reason step-by-step like this:

        Question: {user input}
        Thought: I should use {Tool} to find...
        Action: {tool name}
        Action Input: {input to the tool}
        Observation: {tool result}
        Thought: Now that I know this, I can...
        Final Answer: {final output to the user}
