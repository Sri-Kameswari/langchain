4. How the Agent Uses Observations to Refine Its Thoughts

    Each observation becomes new knowledge for the agent.

    Here’s how refinement works:

        a) The LLM looks at the latest observation.

        b) It updates its context — “Now I know X.”

        c) It rethinks the next best step based on this new info.

    This allows the agent to:

        Correct earlier assumptions

        Handle multi-step reasoning

        Chain multiple tools intelligently

    So it’s like a human saying:

        “I tried this, saw the result, and now I realize I should take a different approach.”


    ReAct agents are dynamic — their reasoning adapts to what they discover:

        If a tool returns unexpected output, the agent can change its plan.

        If a tool fails, the LLM can recover (“The tool didn’t return data, maybe I should try another.”).

        If partial information is found, it can fill gaps by rethinking what’s missing.
