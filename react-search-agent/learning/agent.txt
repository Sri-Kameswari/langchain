1. What is an Agent?

    An agent in LangChain (and AI in general) is like a decision-making engine that:

        Thinks about a user’s query,

        Decides which tools (APIs, databases, functions) to use,

        Acts by using those tools,

        Observes the result,

        And then reasons again based on that new information.

    👉 In short:

        An agent is an AI system that autonomously decides what actions to take to achieve a goal — instead of just generating one-off text responses.

    For example:
        If you ask, “What’s the current temperature in Hyderabad and how does it compare to yesterday?”
        → The agent doesn’t know the answer directly.
            It will:

            Think: “I need the current temperature.”

            Use a weather API tool.

            Observe the result.

            Think again: “Now I need yesterday’s data.”

            Use the same tool again.

            Observe and compare.

            Finally, generate a final answer for you.
