3. The Iterative Thought–Action–Observation Loop

    This is the core reasoning loop that drives ReAct agents.

    Each iteration works like this:

    Step	            Description
    Thought	            The agent reasons about the current state: “What do I know? What should I do next?”
    Action	            The agent decides on an action (like calling a tool) and executes it.
    Observation	        The agent receives and interprets the result of that action.

    Then it loops back:
        → The new observation feeds into the next thought, refining the reasoning.

    Eg.
        Question: What’s the square root of the current temperature in Hyderabad?

        Thought: I need to find the current temperature first.
        Action: WeatherAPI
        Action Input: "Hyderabad"

        Observation: 36°C

        Thought: Now I can compute the square root of 36.
        Action: Calculator
        Action Input: "sqrt(36)"

        Observation: 6

        Final Answer: The square root of the current temperature in Hyderabad is 6.
